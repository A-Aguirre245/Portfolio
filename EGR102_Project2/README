This project used a photoresistor and an LED circuit with the code to measure the amount of reflected light from three specific materials (wood, plastic, and paper).
After those pre-measurements were taken, a detector would be placed over one of the three materials and cause a servo motor to move and indicate to the user
which material of the three was being sensed.
