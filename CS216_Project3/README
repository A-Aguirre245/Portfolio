This project focused on the Breadth First Search Algorithm to explore a dictionary comprised of four-letter words. It would take in 2 user input strings, word1 and word2, 
and search the dictionary to see if there was a path connecting word1 to word2 by changing one letter at a time from word1. If a path existed, it would be printed out.
