This projcect implemented an IMDB like website, where users could input two movies and get back a list of actors in both movies, common actors in both movies, or actors in one movie
but not the other. In addition, users could also input an actors name and display all the movies they worked in with their co-actors. As a result, it functioned as a database with various
different search functions.
